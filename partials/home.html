                  weather conditions like heavy rainfalls and winters. It produces their own pesticides, so no
                  chemicals are being used as
                  pesticides and it does not affect the environment too. The food has good nutritions in it like

                  When we see us in the future world in 2100, we find many
                  challenges. The world depending full on AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI has changed the
                  industries, medical systems, day-to-day tasks, and many more. There would be global
                  warming which leads to climate concern but the only energy we as humans deend on artifical
                  intelligence. There would not be anything natural left.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The thought that there are humans staying in the Mars could be truth and people can travel from
                  one planet to another like they are travelling from one country to another. Travelling in rocket
                  would be a normal thing at that time.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The medical system would be so advanced that the life
                  expectancy of humans would be long. Online education can lead to higher literacy rate which
                  means more educated
                  people.Digitalization would lead to more cyber crime and people will know each other on some
                  social platform.
                  Travelling and visiting places would be digital and in 360 degree view.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Everyone would be like robots in 2100.
